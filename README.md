This exercises were part of the Programming Language Course. We left the most interesting ones, in our opinion. 

- The While Language is the simple programming language used in the course to better understand some basic principles of programming languages. Project includes a simple implementation of its abstract syntax tree and semantics.

- The Lambda Calculus was studied in the course as well. In this exercises we implemented evaluation of expressions in pure lambda calculus by Call-By-Name and Call-By-Value notation.

All code was written in OCaml language.

Each of the projects has its own readme file with a more concrete explanation.

Implemented by myself and [Yoav Shragay](https://github.com/yoavShragay)

Enjoy!
